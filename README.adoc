== A starter kit for problem solving in a Kata

An attempt to provide a set of documents that help guide decisions during a Architecture Kata and or solve any non trivial problem in software

.Tries to cover the following :
* A Legend.adoc file that talks about the overall scenario of what we are looking to do for any problem
* The ArchitectureDiagram folder contains a template C4 diagram that can be copied and used in you favorite IDE to generate one as per your needs
* Strategy documents that individually talk about what questions to try to answer(at the least) when coming up with a strategy

IMPORTANT: Use the PlantUML plugin for Intellij or VS code to be able to view the C4 in its glory
           Uses the amazing work of https://github.com/RicardoNiepel/C4-PlantUML to visualize C4 diagrams
